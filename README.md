# Introduction to Azure Machine Learning Workshop

## Visual ML Classification

In this workshop we will use [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) to predict and flag students who are at risk of dropping a course.

Azure Machine Learning Studio is a collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions without needing to write code.  

A new [visual interface for Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-concept-visual-interface) is currently in preview and  supports many of the same drag-and-drop modules as Azure Machine Learning Studio.

### Prerequisites

- Access to an Azure Subscription
- Completion of the [Azure Fundamentals Lab](https://aka.ms/edu/Azure101)

### Syllabus

All sessions are 50 minutes in length, except for the assessments, which take 15 minutes. A 10-minute health and coffee-snack break is provided  between sessions. A 45-minute lunch is served.
#### Lab 1
	• Establishing access to the cloud service, navigating the screens, reviewing and summarizing data. 
	• Designing and training a linear model, interpreting the output 

#### Lab 2
	• Decision trees for regression, other regression models 
	• Model assessment, validation and cross validation 
#### Lab 3
	• Classification methods: logistic regression, decision trees, other classification models 
	• Evaluation of classifiers: ROC, confusion matrix 
#### Lab 4
	• Additional models: neural networks, processing images, random forests 
	• Additional capabilities of the Auto ML tool: time series forecasting, ensemble models, rebalancing training data, deployment into operations
