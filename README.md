# Introduction to Azure Machine Learning Workshop

## Visual ML Classification

In this workshop we will use [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) to predict and flag students who are at risk of dropping a course.

Azure Machine Learning Studio is a collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions without needing to write code.  

A new [visual interface for Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-concept-visual-interface) is currently in preview and  supports many of the same drag-and-drop modules as Azure Machine Learning Studio.

### Prerequisites

- Access to an Azure Subscription
- Completion of the [Azure Fundamentals Lab](https://aka.ms/edu/Azure101)

### Syllabus
