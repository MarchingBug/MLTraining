# Predictive Analytics  for Business Analysts

## Introduction

In this workshop we will use [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) to predict **need to define the experiment**

Azure Machine Learning Studio is a collaborative, drag-and-drop visual workspace where you can build, test, and deploy machine learning solutions without needing to write code.  

A new [visual interface for Azure Machine Learning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/ui-concept-visual-interface) is currently in preview and  supports many of the same drag-and-drop modules as Azure Machine Learning Studio.
